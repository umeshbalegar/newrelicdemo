# Server Client NIO Demo

## This application demonstrates the Server - Client using Java NIO.

### Assumptions and understanding from requirement.
- Server and client should connect to each other through Socket. 
- Client sends a payload which composed of exactly nine decimal digits (e.g.: 314159265 or 007007009) immediately followed by a serverÂ­native newline sequence; or a termination sequence followed by newline sequence.
- log file named "numbers.log" will be available for the user to view in the home directory.
- The numbers are trimed will all the prefixing zeros in the log file. 
- No duplicates are present in the log files. 
- 5 concurrent users are allowed at anytime. 
- Validation of the data 
  - Numbers should be 9 and only digits, 
  - No characters accepted (except the "terminate" word)
- Every 10s a report showing 
  - how many unique number sent to the server in the 10s time frame. (in the batch)
  - How many duplicates were sent in the batch. 
  - Totally how many numbers are processed so far since the server started. 
- Keeping performance in mind, (i.e 2M numbers in 10s), this solution limits the payload to include max of 3200 numbers which is same as the buffer size. Any additional numbers passed causes Buffer Overflow exception. I do have the solution to take larger inputs but the performance is not as good as limiting the paylod to buffer size, as it demands multiple reads from the channel which is a costly operation w.r.t time. 

### Server starter file is ServerImpl.java in com.newrelic.nio.server package
This class is a concrete implementation of the server, which provides the implementation for processing the data and cleanup on shutdown methods. 


### com.newrelic.nio.server.Server.java 
Abstract class which pretty much sets up all the necessary resources for the Server to start. 
- Initilizes the NIO Selector and opens the ServerSocket for channels. 
- Sets up an executorservice for 5 concurrent connections (acceptexecutor). 
- Sets up an executorservice for ReportingService to log report every 10s.
- Provides 2 additional hooks for processing the data and clean up for the concrete class to implement. 


### Package com.newrelic.nio.handlers has all the EventHandlers
- NumberStorageHandler : Responsible for adding the incoming message into an internal cache and then adding this to the Queue.
- BatchTotalUpdateHandler : Responsible for appending the counts inbetween 10s intervals for ReportingService. (This value is ultimately used to get the duplicates, unique counts for each batch)


### Package com.newrelic.socket.service has all the Services
- InMemoryCacheService : Singleton responsible for holding all the numbers which have come to the server so far. Maintains Unique values. 
- MonitorQueueService : Singleton responsible for maintaining the Queue of incoming messages and also a writer to the file "numbers.log"
- ReportingService : Service responsible for Reporting the results so far every 10s.


### Package com.newrelic.nio.client 
- Has the Client to invoke the Server and transfer the numbers required.

### Package com.newrelic.nio.util 
- Has a util class which has a threadpool generator and stop utility functions. 

### Package com.newrelic.nio 
- Has the mainclass which will start both Server and client for the demo. 
You have the option to run in an autoshutdown mode. 



# Building Jar file
To buiid a jar use below command
```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

After the jar is built use below command to run in an autoshutdown mode.
```bash
java -jar target/serverclient-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar autoshutdown
```

No Autoshutdown mode
```bash
java -jar target/serverclient-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

After the jar executes you can view the "numbers.log" file contents by executing the below command.

**Note:** By default the numbers.log file is written to users home directory. 
```bash
cat ~/numbers.log
```


# Building Docker image
Run the command 
```bash
docker build . -t tagName
```

This will creat the required dockercontainer to run. 

and then you can run this container using docker run command.

I have an optimized docker image created and uploaded in dockerhub, you can pull that image to start quick. [serverclient](https://cloud.docker.com/u/umeshbalegar/repository/docker/umeshbalegar/serverclient)
```bash
docker pull umeshbalegar/serverclient:demo

docker run umeshbalegar/serverclient:demo

OR (below is for autoshutdown feature)

docker run umeshbalegar/serverclient:demo autoshutdown
```

After running the container if you want to look at the "numbers.log" file, you can get into docker shell by executing below commands. 

```bash
docker ps
(this lists all the running containers)

docker exec -ti <containerId from above cmd> /bin/sh
(this gets you into the docker shell)

cat ~/numbers.log
(this prints the file on console)
```

All the required test files are in test folder.
